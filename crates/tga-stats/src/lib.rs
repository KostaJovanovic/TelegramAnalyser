//! Every figure the analyser computes, as named types.
//!
//! This is the whole interface between the two halves of the program:
//! `tga-metrics` fills a [`Stats`] in, `tga-report` reads one out, and neither
//! knows the other exists. That is the same property the layering rule always
//! had — it is what lets `--stats` dump a run and `--from-stats` replay it
//! through the writer with no export on disk — except that the shape now has
//! names the compiler checks, where before it was a `serde_json::Value` and a
//! misspelt key read as zero.
//!
//! # Two things about the JSON
//!
//! **Key order is not declaration order.** [`write`] sorts every object, so
//! moving a field here moves nothing in the file. `save.bat baseline` compares
//! a dump against an earlier copy of itself byte for byte, and a diff that
//! reorders itself when somebody rearranges a struct is a diff nobody reads.
//!
//! **A `[label, count]` pair is a [`Count`], and it still serialises as a
//! two-element array.** There are nine of these branches — days, months, emoji,
//! domains, hashtags, mentions, stickers, forward sources and message lengths.
//! Named fields on this side, the same bytes on the other.
