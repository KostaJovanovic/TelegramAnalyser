//! An export that is a SQLite file rather than a folder.
//!
//! TelegramExporter gained a third output format: one `telegram.sqlite` that
//! accumulates across runs instead of a fresh folder per pass. A run with only
//! that format on writes **no `result.json` at all**, so such an export was
//! invisible to an analyser that looks for one — `load` failed with "No
//! result.json under …" and there was nothing else to try.
//!
//! **This is a different container, not a different format.** `messages.payload`
//! is the same message map `result.json` carries, and `topics.head` is the same
//! header minus the three keys the tables hold instead (`name`, `type`, `id`).
//! So this crate reads rows, rebuilds those maps, and hands them to
//! [`tga_read::one`] and [`tga_read::header_topic`]. Nothing about a message,
//! a clock or a thread is decided twice.
//!
//! What the database has that a folder never did — `deleted_seen` on a message
//! Telegram no longer returns, the `versions` of an edited one, and the `runs`
//! table — is read but not yet carried into the model. See `PLAN.md`.
