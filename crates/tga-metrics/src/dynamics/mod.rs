//! How the group behaves *towards each other*, and how that changes over time.
//!
//! Five figures, all of which the counting elsewhere leaves unanswerable:
//!
//! * **`pairs`** — the graph section already says who talks *at* whom. A
//!   directed edge cannot tell a conversation from a broadcast: somebody who
//!   answers everyone and is answered by nobody has the same fan-out as the
//!   person at the centre of the group. Ranking a pair by `min(there, back)`
//!   asks the other question — who talks *with* whom — and the two lists are
//!   not the same list.
//! * **`answer`** — the median reply latency is one number for an archive that
//!   behaves nothing like itself at 04:00 and at 21:00. Cut by the hour the
//!   *parent* was posted, it answers the question somebody actually has: post
//!   this now, and how long until anyone sees it.
//! * **`tenure`** — `people.rows` carries a `first` and a `last` per person and
//!   the timeline draws their ribbon, but nothing states the fact those two
//!   dates carry: whether they are still here. A row with 4,000 messages whose
//!   last one was eight months ago is not a description of the group today.
//! * **`retention`** — `churn` counts arrivals and departures Telegram
//!   *announced*, which misses everyone who simply stopped typing. Month over
//!   month, of the people who spoke last month, how many spoke again.
//! * **`depth`** — reply chains. `conversation` measures the first hop; this
//!   measures how far a thread actually runs before it dies.
//!
//! Two inherited rules are load-bearing here and are not re-derived:
//!
//! *Latency is measured on epoch seconds*, never the wall clock, and the same
//! [`LATENCY_CAP`] applies — a reply three days later is somebody returning to
//! a thread, not a response time.
//!
//! *A reply to the message that opened a forum topic is not a reply.* The
//! reader drops those once, so the chains below are threads rather than the
//! whole topic hanging off its own first message.
